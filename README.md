Mini-Project Goal: Heart Disease Predictive Model Project: 
 1. Applied Neural Networks to work on Heart Disease Predictive Model to demonstrate the application of AI in healthcare analytics. 
 2. Contributed to the development of a predictive model that aids in the early detection of heart disease using relevant data and machine learning algorithms.
Major-Project Goal: Image Classification Project: 
 1.Created a Neural Network for image classification specifically  to distinguish  between images with and without masks. 
 2.Leveraged machine learning techniques to build a model capable of classifying images into the categories "mask" and "without_masks." 
Technologies used: Python,Jupyter Notebook,Google Collab.
