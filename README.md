Mini-Project Goal: Heart Disease Predictive Model Project: 

 1. Applied Neural Networks to work on Heart Disease Predictive Model to demonstrate the application of AI in healthcare analytics.
    
 2. Contributed to the development of a predictive model that aids in the early detection of heart disease using relevant data and machine learning algorithms.

We build a simple neural network using classification model(Supervised Learning Technique) to make a heart disease predictive model to predict the “target” column of dataset.We used keras algorithm for developing and evaluating deep learning models. 
    
Major-Project Goal: Image Classification Project: 

 1. Created a Neural Network for image classification specifically  to distinguish  between images with and without masks. 
 
 2. Leveraged machine learning techniques to build a model capable of classifying images into the categories "mask" and "without_masks."

In addition to above project, we also build a Convolution Neural Network which is used for image classification.Using  CNN , we classified and predicted masked and non-masked images.
 
Technologies used: Python,Jupyter Notebook,Google Collab.

Project Status:Completed

 SQL Project: Data Cleaning
 In this project, I have taken a raw housing data and transform the data into Microsoft SQL server and performed data cleaning operations.
Project Status: Completed

POWER BI Dashboard Project:
Worked on Superstore dataset to visualize the data and drawn the insights.
